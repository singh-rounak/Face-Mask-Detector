# Face-Mask-Detector
OVERVIEW:
This project implements a deep learning model to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks. Utilizing computer vision techniques, the system processes images or video streams to identify faces and classify them as either "Mask" or "No Mask".

FEATURES:
Real-Time Detection: Processes live video streams to detect face masks in real-time.
Deep Learning Model: Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces.
User-Friendly Interface: Displays detection results with bounding boxes and labels on the video feed.

PRER:EQUISITES
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib

INSTALLATION:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/singh-rounak/Face-Mask-Detector.git
cd Face-Mask-Detector

2. Extract the dataset:
Unzip the datafm.rar file to access the dataset.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open and execute the Face Mask Detector.ipynb notebook to train the model and perform detections.

USAGE
1. Training the Model:

The notebook guides you through loading the dataset, preprocessing images, and training the CNN model.

2. Real-Time Detection:

After training, the model can process live video feeds from your webcam to detect face masks.

Results
The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between masked and unmasked faces. Sample outputs are provided in the repository images.
